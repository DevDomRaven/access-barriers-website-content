Automatic sliding gates provide a high security solution for many sites and can be used on rising driveways as they do not have to “rise up” the driveway and can be utilised providing there is room for one or two leaves to slide in one or either direction beyond the opening.
Telescopic gates are ideal in achieving the maximum clear opening where run back is restricted and can be made with up to five sections of mesh, wooden infil or bars of mild steel allowing for run back to be reduced by up to 75%, compared to a single leaf gate.
